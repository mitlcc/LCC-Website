			<h2>Casino Rueda</h2>
			The MIT Casino Rueda Group is an entirely student-run organization. Its founding members learned the dance in places such as Miami and San Francisco, and have been spreading the dance to others at MIT and beyond since the fall of 1999. We hold workshops once or twice a month, that provide an intense rueda experience. Workshops last 3 hours, and cost between $5-10 per person, but FREE to MIT students.

			<h2>La Union Chicana por Atzlan</h2>
			Our organization, La Unión Chicana por Aztlán (LUChA), is dedicated to providing both cultural and academic support to students who identify in any way with Mexican American culture. We accomplish this mainly by building strong friendships, in the process of which we are able to benefit from academic review sessions put on by our cabezones, enchilada dinners prepared by our cocineros, parties partied by our safados, discussions organized by our politicos, performances put on by our artistas,conferences organized by our representantes and the list goes on.The diversity within LUChA reflects the fact that Chicano culture has evolved to include influences from just about every region of the U.S. and several regions beyond. You will also find similar variety in the views held among our members. Some may call for organized protest where others may prefer a more conservative approach. Some may believe that tamales will sell well when others want to go with mole. Some may prefer to focus on a conference while others may want to focus on our collective academic performance. Our different backgrounds naturally prompt differing responses in any given situation, but our common goals allow us to remain united and move forward.

			<h2>Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers</h2>
			Our student chapter at MIT was established in 1987. Since then, it has grown to over 50 active and 100 general members. Members DO NOT have to be Hispanic or engineering students to participate. We offer a broad range of opportunities to our members from networking and job opportunities with industry to assistance in the graduate school application process. We also seek to help others in our community by mentoring middle school school students through the STEM program and encouraging them to pursue higher education, and through other community service work in the greater Boston area.
