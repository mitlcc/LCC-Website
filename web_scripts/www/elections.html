I would love to be the 2016-2017 LCC president because I am super interested in making the LCC a more diverse and inclusive community. Over the past 2 years I’ve been attending LLA meetings, which helped give me a better understanding of the LCC Latinx groups on campus. In turn, such experiences made me more aware of our strengths and weakness. I believe the main issue the LCC is facing now is a lack of diversity. Many Latinx students do not feel identified with the LCC because they don’t feel represented in LCC organizations, and unfortunately, they decide to stop coming to our events after attending a few times. I would like to change this pattern and attract other Latinx students and organizations by enforcing more cooperation and collaboration among the existing LCC Latinx organizations by decreasing the requirements required for other Latinx organizations to be part of the LCC and promoting cultural awareness. <br>

As a leader and active member of the LCC board, I would like to implement “Latin Cultural Friday,” an informal event that would occur on the first Friday of each month. On Latin Cultural Fridays, we would learn about a Latin American country (flag, facts, history, music, and food) that lacks representation in the LCC . I believe this would have a big impact not only in the Latinx MIT community, but also in the MIT community since people from other cultures would be able to learn more about all different Latin American countries and understand what makes our Latino Heritage extremely rich, unique, and ultimately, beautiful. <br><br>

	I have served as the Leader of the Latino Leaders Assembly (LLA) for a year, and I have greatly enjoyed getting to know the members of the LCC and interacting with Latinos all over campus. When the political situation in Venezuela became increasingly dangerous during my sophomore year, the LCC was the one place where I felt comfortable going to talk about it. It was amazing to find a somewhere I felt comfortable expressing myself and a community of people willing to listen. By acting President, I hope to provide that same space and support to other students on campus. Together with Raul Boquin as my Vice President, these are some of the steps we would take next year to make the LCC a more welcoming and stronger community:<br>

-We will make it easier for organizations to get the support they need from the LCC.<br> 
We will achieve this through event planning and retreat work with our member groups.<br>
-We will get regular feedback on our progress through LLA GBMs and regular meetings with MIT’s administration. <br>
-We will increase our outreach to not only our five member organizations, but to any organization that may identify as "Latino.” We will also make strides towards collaborating with other groups on campus, such as the BSU, MSA, and Rainbow Lounge. And finally, we will collaborate with graduate students, alumni, faculty and staff.<br>

Raul and I work powerfully together, and because we have such a passion for this center, I truly believe we can make an impact that all of you can be a part of. <br><br><br>

Greetings,
<br>
My name is Raul Boquin - I have been part of Latino life at MIT since my freshman spring semester. When I joined MAES and SHPE, the upperclassmen that led those organizations encouraged me and motivated me to be part of a community stronger and more powerful than anything I've ever known before. They wanted me to be part of the Latino community - one that has shaped my path and trajectory for not only MIT but my whole career and life.<br>

Because of our Latino Lounge, our people who come together, and the new faces I meet, I have been able to execute what I am most passionate about: education for a community that is underprivileged yet strong. I intend to run for vice president to do just that. Along with Deborah Plana, we will unite our community. We will make it easier for organizations to get the support they need from the LCC.
We will achieve this through event planning and retreat work with our member groups. We will getregular feedback on our progress through LLA GBMs and regular meetings with MIT’s administration. <br>

And finally, we will collaborate with graduate students, alumni, faculty and staff.<br>

Deborah and I work powerfully together, and because we have such a passion for this center, I truly believe we can make an impact that all of you can be a part of. <br>

Having been part of the executive board this past year, I had a chance to observe the different positions and their responsibilities. This past year, I represented the LCC as Publicity Director and although I had a lot of fun putting my skills into practice to publicize our events, I feel like I have other skills that are stronger and would be of better use for the LCC in another position. I am choosing to run again to be part of the executive board because, being the only freshman on the board, it is a great way to be involved in the Latino community and get to know al lot of the people while promoting our culture in impactful ways. 
<br>
I have strong organizational skills and I believe also strong leadership skills, due to my significant experience with leading various clubs and being in other leadership roles during high school. Personally, I also always try to be very conscientious of everyone that I am working with so that all of their opinion's are being heard and we reach the best solution for the organization overall. Currently, from observing how the LCC works from a sort of "outsider's" point of view (as a freshman), I've had a chance to reflect on what works and what does not (what is bringing the community together and what is tearing it apart) and, if elected Vice President, I will like to focus more energy next year on emphasizing more the positive qualities that we have and working on dismantling those that are tearing us apart. For example, I would like to hold a discussion with all the executive members of the clubs regarding their relationship with the LCC exec and how they think this relationship can be improved so that the Latino community comes together more as a whole then the separate parts that it feels like sometimes right now. I hope you will consider me as your next Vice President, as I will bring my past experience and my new ideas, which I believe make me a competent candidate. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me at alyda@mit.edu, through message, or in person. Thank you.

                <b><i>Luzdary Ruelas<br></i></b></center>
I want to run for Director of External Affairs because I feel that this position allows the most flexibility to interpret it in many ways. As Director of External Affairs I would want to continue the efforts Silvia has made to connect the undergraduate Latino community to the graduate Latino community and I would also like use to get to know the community more. In terms of qualifications relating to this position, I have served as the president of LUChA this semester and as such I served as the point of communication for anything that LUCha did, including the visit from Dream Academy during spring break. I hope to gain more connections to the MIT administration through this position and potentially develop my relationship building skills because sometimes I have a hard time communicating with people. <br>

However, I do feel that this struggle with communication has been decreasing through my involvement in clubs. I feel that in order to improve the LCC we need to improve its relationship with the clubs under it. Having served on one of these boards I found that LCC was mostly there to administer tasks that have been done traditionally and although it was made known that they are a source of support I feel that many of the clubs are not used to this so they do not ask for help. I am not sure how this could be accomplished without it seeming like the LCC is stepping on the clubs toes but I do think the clubs would benefit from more help from the LCC. In addition, as of now I feel that all of the clubs are they’re own separate entities, which is good, but this also makes the Latino community come off feeling very disjointed. This could maybe be ameliorated through this LCC setting up mixers for the clubs without them needing to do anything but show up. But I think before the Latino community can contribute its voice to all of the changes going on in the Institute currently, we need to unite all of the voices to come off as the strong influence that I truly believe we could be.<br>
<br>

<center><b><i>Matias Hanco<br></i></b></center>
As a member of LUCHA and MAES, I have noticed how amazing a space the LCC is for events pertaining to the Latino community. The space is not only used to host the student groups I am in and others, but they also provide a haven for Latino students to relax, do work, or meet others interested in celebrating the Hispanic culture. Without the LCC the Latino community at MIT may not be as strong as it is today, and I admire that.<br>

Treasurer of the LCC seems right for me because I pay close attention to my personal finances, especially since money has become a problem for my family. I believe it is this shrewdness that has made me a reliable Treasurer for Spanish House this past semester. I have handled account balances with care, double checking and triple checking to make sure that the numbers add up. I have met personally with people to ask for receipts when they forget because I want save them money - I know I would want someone else to do the same for me. I treat other people’s resources like I would treat mine, and I feel like I have shown that from the positive responses that I got from the House and (likely) from the nominations for this position.<br>

I want to contribute to the LCC through my skills in finance, and I believe I have the experience to do just that.<br>

My name is Isabel Naomi Quispe, currently a freshman here at MIT, and would be interested in being the Director of the Latino Leaders Assembly. In terms of experience, I have been vice president of the Eco-Club in my high school, organizing meetings with representatives of various NGOs to discuss possible collaborations between both of our groups in the running of events like tree planting and beach cleanups. Here at MIT, I am the secretary of E33 Productions, the student-run lighting group, as well as a production manager. As the secretary, I am in charge of taking the minutes in the Exec meetings, approving the hours of E33 student workers and working with the Treasurer to maintain the archives of shows we have done and keeping a log of the level of training of each member. As a production manager, I am responsible for being the contact person between the groups that hire E33 to do lighting for their events and E33, and looking for members that would be available to work on the day of the venue.<br>

I feel that I have the experience to be the point of contact between different groups and I am organized, therefore would be able to perform tasks such as making the agenda available and keeping an updated list of the officers in the mailing list. What I hope to get out of being the Director of the LLA is to hone my organizational and leadership skills, and become more experienced in leading meetings. Lastly, I have wanted to become a closer part of the Latino community here at MIT, as I am an international student from Peru, and I feel that being part of the LCC Executive Board would be a good opportunity to get to know more of you. <br>

<center><b><i>Alyda Huerta<br></i></b></center>
This past year I was part of the LCC executive board as Publicity Director. Being the only freshman on the board, I had a lot to learn but I loved doing my work for the LCC and having the opportunity to be involved in the Latino community and interact with so many people. Since I was trying to learn how things worked, I did a lot of observation during my time on the board and saw what worked and what did not when we planned and executed events<br>

I love planning taking charge and planning the exact logistics of details and handing out tasks because it is part of my natural personality. I also have strong organizational skills which I used with my role as Publicity Director this past year but I believe would be more beneficial to the board as Director of Operations. During high school, I was in charge of planning the logistics for a lot of events for my clubs and doling out tasks to other members, and I found that I was very efficient with that because I was good at foreseeing what would make things run more smoothly. 
<br>
If elected Director of Operations, I plan to improve communication between the members of the executive board so that individual tasks are more clear and we are more efficient when executing events by making "guides" for each event that has timelines and specific task that each person should accomplish with descriptions for possible ways to execute them. I really enjoyed being part of the executive board this past year and I believe that my current skills will allow me to be a competent Director of Publicity, allowing me to continue my time on the executive board to keep working with the Latino community. Please do not hesitate to contact me at alyda@mit.edu, through message, or in person. Thank you for your consideration. <br><br>

<center><b><i>Melissa Gianello<br></i></b></center>
This year I joined the MAES exec board and was amazed by not only how much I learned about leadership within the position but how much I came to love being involved within the Latino community. I am hoping to increase my involvement next year by joining the LCC as historian. 
As historian my goal would be to increase awareness of the individual Latino groups on campus and highlight their activities through the monthly Voz Latina newsletters and updated LCC website. Voz Latina is a great way to advertise future events within the LCC groups and also highlight specific individuals within our community to share their achievements with the rest of MIT. Additionally, for our current members, I would want to document all the events through pictures and make those available. I feel qualified for this position because I am very organized, and am willing to make time to go to all the LCC events so that I can document them and be a representative from the LCC.
